This is a repository where I'm working through the online open source ["slam book"](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook-en).
But instead of using g2o, Sophus, and C++, I'm using Symforce and python. 

One day I might consider doing a fork of the slam book itself to for using Symforce, 
but that is a project for another day.
